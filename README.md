## Data Link Protocol Project
### Grade 15.8/20

#### Goals
- Implement a data link layer protocol, according to the specification provided: this protocol implements transmitter and receiver functionality to transfer a file stored on a computer hard disk between computers connected through a RS-232 serial cable
- Develop a simple transmitter and receiver data transfer application to test the protocol, according to the specification provided in this document
- the application to be developed uses/invokes the functions implemented by the data link layer protocol
- the data link layer protocol thus offers/exposes an API to the upper layer

#### Development environment
- LINUX
- Programming language – C
- Serial port RS-232 (asynchronous communication)
